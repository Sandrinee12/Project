<h4>Early life and Education</h4>
<hr>
<p>William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington[3] as the only son of William H.<br> Gates Sr.[b] (1925–2020) and his first wife, Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).[4] His ancestry includes English,<br> German, and Irish/Scots-Irish.[5] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors<br> of First Interstate BancSystem and United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather J. W. Maxwell was a national bank president.<br> Gates also has an older sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or "Trey"<br> (i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix.[6][7] The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado<br> when Gates was 7.[8]

    When Gates was young his parents wanted him to pursue a career in law.[9] During his childhood, his family regularly attended a church <br>of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.[10][11][12] Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child.[7]<br> The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; <br>there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".[13]</p>
